Aug 10 - hoping to get my new menus in this week. then onto Daily.js to tweak the chat window?

Need to lose the Bootstrap menu from the Pythonanyhere pages - want hamburger menu for bet mobile look.  June 3 

CSS, Html, and JS need work - Basic Python multiple quiz Forked from JakeKandell/quiz-site. This will beome Computer Tutor site content. Idea is to provide free unlimited practice test based upon the actual bank of questions the real citizenship test draws from. I have 150 question available from Richmond BC public libary site. The second aspect of the site/service will be basic literacy mentoring - Basic Literacy being defined as ability to read and make notes from a Newspaper story. Level presumed to be around 6 grade public school English.  Will include links to Computer Tutor - Online Learning Systems if individual attention is requested.

Vocabulary quiz setup much like the citizenship quiz will assist with basic English vocabulary building.  All of this will be open and free with no log in required.  More advanced one-to-one mentoring would be arranged via the Computer Tutor Site.
