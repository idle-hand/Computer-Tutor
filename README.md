Technical details

The platform is built using CSS, HTML, and JS  The idea behind SpeakEasy is to provide free unlimited practice tests based on the actual bank of questions from the real Canadian Citizenship Test. The platform has access to 150 questions from the Richmond BC public library site.

In addition to citizenship test practice, SpeakEasy also aims to provide basic literacy mentoring. Basic literacy is defined as the ability to read and make notes from a newspaper story, with a presumed level of around 6th grade public school English. The platform will include links to Computer Tutor - Online Learning Systems if individual attention is requested.

A vocabulary quiz setup, much like the citizenship quiz, will be available to assist with basic English vocabulary building. All of the content on SpeakEasy will be open and free with no login required. More advanced one-to-one mentoring can be arranged through the Computer Tutor site.
